This topic provides instructions to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators about how to install, 
configure, and deploy the RabbitMQ for PCF tile to providea pre-provisioned service.

The RabbitMQ open source product provides additional documentation.
For more information about getting started with RabbitMQ and ensuring production readiness,
see the Production Checklist in the [RabbitMQ Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/production-checklist.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The pre-provisioned service
will be deprecated in a future release. Pivotal recommends using the on-demand
service for new deployments. For instructions, see <a href="./install-config.html">
Installing and Configuring RabbitMQ for PCF the On-Demand Service</a>.  </p>

## <a id="rbac"></a>Role-Based Access in Ops Manager

Ops Manager administrators can use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage which 
operators can make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in Ops Manager. 
Therefore, your role permissions might not allow you to perform every procedure in this operator guide.

For more information about roles in Ops Manager, see 
    <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/config-rbac.html#about">
        Understand Roles in Ops Manager</a>.</p>


## <a id="install"></a> Download and Install the Tile

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-rabbitmq-service/).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

3. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of RabbitMQ for PCF.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added **RabbitMQ for PCF** tile.
This lets you begin configuring the tile. The installation is complete when you apply the changes from the configuration.

## <a id="tile_configurations"></a>Configure Pre-Provisioned RabbitMQ for PCF

The configuration screen below appears when you click the RabbitMQ for PCF tile in Ops Manager.
An orange circle beside a tab indicates that you must complete a configuration in the tab.
A green checkmark indicates that the tab is preconfigured and you may optionally change its settings.

  </tr>
  <tr><td>Stemcell</td><td><a href="#stemcell">Stemcell</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## <a id="azs-networks"></a> Assign AZs and Networks

 Follow the steps below to configure the AZs and networks.

 1. In the [Settings](#tile_configurations) screen, click **Assign AZs and Networks**.
     <p class="note warning"><strong>Important</strong>: You cannot change the regions or networks after 
     you have clicked **Apply Changes** in the [final step](#apply-changes) below.</p>

 2. Configure the fields on the **Assign AZs and Networks** as follows.
    **All fields are required**, though some do not apply to the pre-provisioned service.
   <table>
     <tr><th>Required Fields</th><th>Instructions</th></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Place singleton jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select a region.
             This selection only affects the on-demand service.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Balance other jobs in</strong></td>
         <td>Select additional region(s).
             This selection only affects the pre-provisioned service.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td>
         <td>Select a network for the RabbitMQ Broker.<br><br>
             This should be a separate network from the one you select for <strong>Service Network</strong>.
             This network is represented by the Default Network,
             described in <a href="./about.html#on-demand">Default Network and Service Network</a>.
             Typically, you select the network used for the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) or Elastic Runtime components.
         </td></tr>
     <tr><td><strong>Service Network</strong></td>
         <td>Select a network.
             This selection only affects the on-demand service.</td></tr>
   </table>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Changing the Network after you have configured it, or changing the IP configuration,
       results in a failed deployment.
       For more information, see <a href="./changing-ips.html">Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.</p>

 3. Click **Save**.


## <a id="rabbitmq-cluster"></a> RabbitMQ

To configure the following sections in the **RabbitMQ** tab, in the [Settings](#tile_configurations) screen, click **RabbitMQ**.

### <a id='dash'></a>RabbitMQ Admin User Credentials

In the **RabbitMQ admin user credentials** field of the RabbitMQ pane, enter an admin username and password:

<%= image_tag("images/config-credentials.png") %>

You can use a combination of upper or lowercase alphanumerics and supported special characters: `-=_+":;/?.><,~`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot use back quote <code>`</code> or single quote <code>'</code>.</p>

This grants you full admin access to the RabbitMQ Management UI.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To rotate your administrator credentials, enter a new username and password,
  save your options, and redeploy by returning to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and clicking <strong>Apply Changes</strong>.</p>


### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Plugins

Choose which plugins you want to enable in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab.

You must leave the **rabbitmq_management** plugin enabled for this product to work.

<%= image_tag("images/config-plugins.png") %>

For more information about RabbitMQ plugins, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html).

### <a id="haproxy"></a>HAProxy Ports

Enter the ports HAProxy should load balance to the RabbitMQ nodes in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/config-haproxy.png") %>

* All the default ports of all the available plugins are load-balanced by default.
However, if you install extra protocol plugins, or provide a custom configuration that changes the ports RabbitMQ listens on,
then you must update the list of load-balanced ports.

* You must leave the management plugin listening on port `15672` and load balance that port.

* If you change the topology of your RabbitMQ cluster, the HAProxy is automatically reconfigured during the deployment.

### <a id="ssl"></a> SSL

(Optional) Provide SSL certificates and keys for use by the RabbitMQ cluster in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/config_ssl.png") %>

* SSL is simultaneously provided for AMQPS, STOMP and MQTT.
No other plugins are automatically configured for use with SSL.

* If you provide SSL keys and certificates, non-SSL support is disabled. 
If you previously deployed this service without SSL support and 
have apps connected to the service, these apps lose 
their connections and must reconnect using SSL.

* SSL settings are applied equally across all VMs in the cluster.

* You can provide more then one CA certificate.

For more information about SSL support, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html).

### <a id="erlang"></a>Erlang Cookie

(Optional) Provide an Erlang cookie to be used by the cluster in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab.
This is useful if you want to connect directly to the RabbitMQ cluster, for example with `rabbitmqctl`,
or to connect other VMs running Erlang.

<%= image_tag("images/config-erlang.png") %>

#### Known Issues with Erlang Cookie

There are two known issues associated with the Erlang cookie when you do the following:

* [Cluster Scaling](#scaling-issue)
* [Changing the Erlang Cookie Value](#changing-issue)

#### <a id="scaling-issue"></a> Cluster Scaling Known Issue

If you have not set the Erlang cookie and you want to scale out your cluster
size without downtime, follow these steps:

1. Follow the steps in the link below, up to and including the section _Log in to the BOSH Director_:
  [Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather)

1. Run the following command: <br>
    `bosh ssh rabbitmq-server/0`

1. Run the following commands:

    ```
    sudo -i
    echo $(cat /var/vcap/store/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie)
    ```

1. Paste the value returned from the last command into the Erlang cookie field in the **RabbitMQ** tab. 
This field is shown [above](#erlang).

1. To increase the size of your cluster, navigate to the **Resource Config** tab and, in the first row, 
raise the value for the number of **Instances** of the **RabbitMQ node**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, and click **Apply Changes**.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH tells you that the cookie has changed---this is because the
default value in the manifest is empty, which results in an auto-generated
cookie. However, the value of the cookie on the server remains the same, so the known issue
below does <strong>not</strong> apply.</p>

#### <a id="changing-issue"></a> Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue

Changing the Erlang cookie value requires cluster downtime.
Pivotal *strongly* recommends that you do not change anything else during this time, because it is
possible for the configuration to be inconsistently applied during this process.

The deployment might fail after this process. If so, redeploying fixes the issue.

### <a id="configfile"></a> RabbitMQ Configuration

(Optional) Provide a full <code>rabbitmq.config</code> file by pasting its contents in 
the **RabbitMQ configuration** field in the **RabbitMQ** tab.
This `rabbitmq.config` file is then provided to all the nodes in the cluster.

<%= image_tag("images/config_rabbitmq.png") %>


The input in this field must be Base64 encoded.

For example, suppose you want to configure the
`rates_mode` of the `rabbitmq_management` stats below:

```
[
  {rabbitmq_management, [
    {rates_mode, detailed}
  ]}
].
```

1. Encode the file into Base64:

    ```
    WwogIHtyYWJiaXRtcV9tYW5hZ2VtZW50LCBbCiAgICB7cmF0ZXNfbW9kZSwgZGV0YWlsZWR9CiAgXX0KXS4K
    ```

2. Paste the above into the **RabbitMQ configuration** field:

    <%= image_tag("images/config_rabbitmq_file.png") %>


You can see an example `rabbitmq.config` file [here](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/stable/docs/rabbitmq.config.example).
For more information about the RabbitMQ configuration, see the [RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html).

### <a id="tls"></a>TLS Support

Configure TLS in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/config_tls.png") %>

* TLS v1.0 is disabled by default, due to security issues.

* TLS v1.1 and v1.2 are enabled by default and can be turned on and off.


### External Load Balancer

(Optional) Enter a DNS name or IP address of an external load balancer to be returned in the binding credentials (`VCAP_SERVICES`)
to app developers.
Enter this in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/config-elb.png") %>


If you configure an external load balancer, to avoid an unnecessary VM deployment, 
in the **Resource Config** tab set the **HAProxy for RabbitMQ** instance count to **0**.


### <a id="polling"></a>Metrics Polling Interval

The metrics polling interval is set in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/metrics_polling.png") %>

The default setting is 30 seconds for all deployed components.
Pivotal recommends that you do not change this interval.
  In order to avoid overwhelming components, do not set this below 10 seconds.

Changing this setting affects all deployed instances.


### Disk Free Alarm Limit <a id="disk_free_alarm_selector"></a>

Choose how much disk space RabbitMQ attempts to keep free at any
given time in this section of the **RabbitMQ** tab:

<%= image_tag("images/disk_alarm_threshold.png") %>

RabbitMQ periodically checks if there is sufficient free space on disk. If there is not,
RabbitMQ temporarily stops accepting new messages. This gives your apps time
to consume existing messages, and thus free up some disk space. The RabbitMQ
tile provides four options for this value:

* **50MB** is the minimum value. (Not Recommended)

    Selecting **50MB** is not recommended and can cause data loss. For more information, 
    see [Dangers of Setting This Value Too Low](#too-low) and [When to Use the 50MB Value](#50mb) below.

* **100% Memory** ensures that at the time when RabbitMQ checks the available disk,
  there must be enough space for RabbitMQ to page all memory-based messages out
  to disk.
* **150% Memory** is recommended.
  This is because it is possible that in between disk-space checks, RabbitMQ may:
  - Write persistent messages to disk (using up some disk space).
  - Accept more memory-based messages into various queues.
  - Page all memory-based messages to disk.

    In the above situations, RabbitMQ might require more free disk than it has memory.
* **200% Memory** is a conservative value used when the operator wants higher
  confidence that RabbitMQ never runs out of disk space.



For more information about disk alarms, see the
[RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/disk-alarms.html).

####<a name='too-low'></a> Dangers of Setting This Value Too Low

If the disk of a given RabbitMQ node completely fills while RabbitMQ is running,
that node crashes.
This can lead to data loss, and loss of availability.

RabbitMQ reserves the right to page any and all messages in memory (even
transient messages) to disk at any time. You must set your **Disk free alarm
limit** high enough to ensure that RabbitMQ always has at least enough space to do
this.

#### Disadvantages of Setting This Value Too High

If you set your **Disk free alarm limit** to a value larger than the size of your
persistent disk, then RabbitMQ is not able to free up enough disk space to
accept new messages. Ensure that you have a large enough disk to
persist all the messages you intend to persist while *also* leaving enough
space free to satisfy the **Disk free alarm limit** that you choose.

#### <a name='50mb'></a> When to Use the 50MB Value

Pivotal does not recommend using this value in production. However, if you are experimenting with a
development environment you might want to use a small disk to keep down costs,
though this increases the possibility that RabbitMQ crashes and loses data.

## <a id="networking"></a>Networking

To specify static IP addresses, do the following:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the RabbitMQ tile.
1. In the **Settings** tab, select **Networking**.
1. Configure the fields as follows:<br><br>
  * **Pre-Provisioned HAProxy Static IPs**:
    Enter a comma-delimited list of IP addresses grouped in the order of AZs configured.
    These IP addresses are assigned to your Pre-Provisioned HAproxy nodes.<br><br>
  * **Pre-Provisioned RabbitMQ Server Static IPs**:
    Enter a comma-delimited list of IP addresses grouped in the order of AZs configured.
    These IP addresses are assigned to your Pre-Provisioned RabbitMQ Server nodes.<br><br>
  * **Pre-Provisioned Service Broker Static IP**:
    Enter an IP address. This address must be in the network range of the network name 
    specified in the **Network** drop-down list in the **Assign AZs and Networks** tab
    and must not be in the **Service Network**. 
    This IP address is assigned to your Pre-Provisioned Service Broker node.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If any of the above fields are left blank,
      BOSH allocates an IP address.</p>

    ![Networking](images/config-networking-pp.png)

1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="syslog"></a>Syslog

To enable monitoring for RabbitMQ for PCF, operators forward the syslog by designating 
an external syslog endpoint for RabbitMQ component log messages.
This endpoint serves as the input to a monitoring platform such as Datadog, Papertrail, or SumoLogic.

To specify the destination for RabbitMQ for PCF log messages, do the following:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the RabbitMQ tile.
1. In the RabbitMQ tile, click the **Settings** tab. ![Ops Manager Syslog Forwarding Configuration](images/syslog-config-1.10.0.png)
1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Configure the fields on the Syslog pane as follows:
<table class="nice">
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <tr>
        <td>Syslog address</td>
        <td>IP or DNS address of the syslog server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Syslog port</td>
        <td>Port of the syslog server</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Transport protocol</td>
        <td>Transport protocol of the syslog server. One of `udp`, `tcp`, `relp`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Format for logs</td>
        <td>Format for logs. Pivotal recommends `RFC 5424`, but `Legacy Format` can be used for compatibility reasons.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Enable TLS</td>
        <td>Enable TLS to the syslog server.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Permitted Peer</td>
        <td>If there are several peer servers that can respond to remote syslog connections,
            then you may provide a wildcard in the domain, such as `*.example.com`.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Custom CA Certificate</td>
        <td>If the server certificate is not signed by a known authority, for example, an internal syslog server,
            provide the CA certificate of the log management service endpoint.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

1. Click **Save**.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy with the changes.


## <a id="global-settings"></a>Global Settings

Follow the steps below to enable the shareable instances beta feature.
Sharing a service instance between spaces, allows apps in different spaces to share databases,
messaging queues, and many other types of services. For more information,
see [Sharing Service Instances (Experimental)](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html).

<p class='note warning'><strong>WARNING</strong>: This is a beta feature based on an experimental feature in Cloud Foundry.
Use the feature at your own risk in non-production environments.</p>


1. Click **Global Settings**.

2. Select **(Beta) Shareable Instances** to enable the beta feature for sharing instances.<br>

    ![Sharing Service Instances](images/sharing-instances.png)


3. Click **Save**.

## <a id="singlenode"></a> Dedicated Instance: Single Node Plan

This tab only applies to the on-demand service. However, you must complete the fields on 
this tab even if you are not using the on-demand service. 
Therefore, if you are not using the on-demand service:

* Select or enter any values in the required fields, select the **Acknowledge** checkbox, and click **Save**.

For information on configuring the on-demand service, see [Installing and Configuring the On-Demand Service](./install-config.html).

## <a id='errands'></a>Errands

(Optional) In the **Errands** tab, choose the defaults for when errands run.

Errands can be thought of as tasks. For example, when deploying or updating RabbitMQ for PCF, 
Ops Manager can optionally run a series of [post-deploy errands](#post-deploy-errands).
An example is the **Smoke Tests** errand, which checks the health of the RabbitMQ cluster after a deploy or upgrade.



You can decide whether to run post-deploy errands by toggling them on or off before 
you click **Apply Changes** to update a configuration in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard:

![Configuring One-time Errands](images/errands-installation.png)

This is a one-time action before an update. You can change the above defaults in the **Errands** tab, 
as well as the defaults for [pre-delete](#pre-delete-errands) errands.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Important</strong>: In RabbitMQ for PCF v1.9.0 and later, all post-deploy errands are on by default.
    Pivotal recommends keeping these defaults, because the smoke tests can encounter unexpected issues,
    and on-demand instances of RabbitMQ for PCF might fall behind
    if the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> errand is not on by default.</p>


For more information on errand run rules, see [Errand Run Rules](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-errands.html#run-rules).

## <a id="apply-changes"></a>Apply Configuration and Complete the Installation

Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to complete the installation of RabbitMQ for PCF.

## <a id="other"></a> Other Configuration Topics

### <a id='ha-cluster'></a>Connecting to a Highly Available RabbitMQ Cluster

The RabbitMQ tile, allows for a highly available cluster through multiple
HAProxy nodes. The `hostnames`, `uris` and `hosts` properties have been added
and should be used in preference over the equivalent singular properties. The
singular properties are maintained for backwards compatibility and always
contain the first value from the equivalent plural property. The singular
properties will eventually be deprecated.

For example, with two HAProxy jobs deployed, the following properties will be present:
<pre><code>"hostname": "10.0.0.41",
"hostnames": [
    "10.0.0.41",
    "10.0.0.51"]
</code></pre>

### <a id='port-map'></a>Port to protocol mappings

* 15672 = Management dashboard
* 5672 = RabbitMQ
* 5671 = RabbitMQ SSL
* 1883 = MQTT
* 8883 = MQTT SSL
* 61613 = STOMP
* 61614 = STOMP SSL
* 15674 = Web STOMP
* 4567 = RabbitMQ Service Broker
* 3457 - 3459 = CF Loggregator

### <a id='sec-groups'></a>Security Groups

To enable access to the RabbitMQ tile service, you must ensure your security
group allows access to the HAProxy and RabbitMQ Service Broker VMs configured in your deployment.
You can obtain the IP addresses for these from the Ops Manager **Status** page for the RabbitMQ tile.
Ensure the following ports are enabled for those VMs:

* 15672
* 5672
* 5671
* 1883
* 8883
* 61613
* 61614
* 15674
* 4567
* 3457 - 3459

The following is a template for configuring your Cloud Foundry security groups:
```
[
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<haproxy-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"5671,5672,1883,8883,61613,61614,15672,15674"},
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<service-broker-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"4567"}
]
```

### <a id="asg"></a>Application Security Groups

To allow this service to have network access, you must create
[Application Security Groups](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) (ASGs).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The service is unusable without Application Security Groups.</p>

### Application Container Network Connections

Application containers that use instances of the RabbitMQ service require the following outbound network connections:

|Destination        |Ports       |Protocol   |Reason
|---                |---         |---        |---
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5672         |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP
|`HAProxy IPs`     |5671       |tcp        |Application containers using AMQP over SSL
|`HAProxy IPs`     |1883         |tcp        |Application containers using MQTT

Create an ASG named `rabbitmq-app-containers` with the above configuration and bind it to either:

* The appropriate space
* The `default-running` ASG set if you want to provide access to all started apps.
  Then restart your apps.

  If you are using an external
  load balancer, or have more than one IP address for HAProxy, you must also create egress rules for these.
  For example:

```
[
  {
      "ports": "5671-5672",
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "destination": "10.10.10.10/32"
  }
]
```

### <a id="assigned_ips"></a> Assigned IPs

RabbitMQ for PCF does not support changing the IP addresses which have been assigned to the RabbitMQ deployments.
For example, you cannot change the subnet into which the RabbitMQ cluster was originally provisioned.
Doing so causes the deployment to fail.
For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

### <a id="switching"></a>Preserving Dynamically Assigned IPs

You cannot switch from dynamically assigned IP addresses to a different set of static IP addresses.
However, you can configure Ops Manager so the
current set of dynamically assigned IP addresses always continue to be used.
This might be useful when upgrading.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Status** page in the RabbitMQ tile.
2. Take note of the IP addresses for the RabbitMQ Server and HAProxy for RabbitMQ jobs, in the order nodes appear in the UI.
3. Go to the **Settings** page, and click **Networking**.
4. Enter the IP addresses you got from the **Status** page as a comma-separated list.

5. Click **Save**.


### <a id="no-overwrite"></a>RabbitMQ Server Settings that Cannot be Overwritten

In all cases:

* `rabbit halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt subscription_ttl 1800000`
* `log_levels [{connection,info}]`
* `halt_on_upgrade_failure false`
* `{rabbit, [ {collect_statistics_interval, 60000}] }`
* `{rabbitmq_management, [ {rates_mode, none}] }`

When SSL is enabled:

* `rabbit tcp_listeners []`
* `rabbit ssl_listeners [5671]`
* `rabbitmq_management listener [{port,15672},{ssl,false}]`
* `rabbitmq_mqtt ssl_listeners [8883]`
* `rabbitmq_stomp ssl_listeners [61614]`
