This topic provides operators with basic instructions for troubleshooting on-demand RabbitMQ&reg; for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

<a id="about-cli"></a><h2>About the BOSH CLI</h2>
The BOSH CLI is available in two major versions, v1 and v2. Pivotal recommends that you use the BOSH CLI v2 when possible.

This topic provides examples of using each version of the BOSH CLI. Consult the table below to determine which version of the CLI is supported for your installation.

<table class="nice">
    <th>PCF Version</th>
    <th>BOSH CLI Version</th>
    <tr>
        <td>1.10</td>
        <td>CLI v1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.11</td>
        <td>CLI v1 or CLI v2 (Pivotal recommends CLI v2)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1.12 and later</td>
        <td>CLI v2</td>

<a id="failed-deployment"><h3></a>Failed Deployment on Upgrade or after Apply Changes</h3>

If the deployment fails after editing the <strong>Assign AZs and Networks</strong> pane of the RabbitMQ for PCF tile,
it might be due to a change to the IP addresses assigned to the <code>RabbitMQ Server</code> job.
RabbitMQ for PCF requires that these IP addresses do not change once assigned. 
If you change them, the deployment fails. 
This includes changes made to your current installation or during an upgrade.

To diagnose and solve this issue, see <a href='changing-ips.html'>Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment</a>.

<a id="faq"></a><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<a id="check-deploy"></a><h3>What should I check before deploying a new version of the tile?</h3>

Ensure that all nodes in the cluster are healthy via the RabbitMQ Management UI, or health metrics exposed via the firehose.  
You cannot rely solely
on the BOSH `instances` output as that reflects the state of the Erlang VM used by RabbitMQ and not
the RabbitMQ application.


<a id="stopstart"></a><h3>What is the correct way to stop and start RabbitMQ in PCF?</h3>

Only BOSH commands should be used by the operator to interact with the RabbitMQ app.

For example:

`bosh stop rabbitmq-server` and  `bosh start rabbitmq-server`.


There are BOSH job lifecycle hooks which are only fired when rabbitmq-server is
stopped through BOSH.  You can also stop individual instances by running the stop command and specifying `JOB [index]`

<p class="note"><strong>Note: </strong>Do not use <code>monit stop rabbitmq-server</code> as this does not call the drain scripts</p>

<a id="boshstop"></a><h3>What happens when I run bosh stop rabbitmq-server?</h3>

BOSH starts the shutdown sequence from the bootstrap instance.

We start by telling the RabbitMQ application to shutdown and then shutdown the
Erlang VM within which it is running. If this succeeds, we run the following
checks to ensure that the RabbitMQ application and Erlang VM have stopped:

1. If `/var/vcap/sys/run/rabbitmq-server/pid` exists, check that the PID inside
this file does not point to a running Erlang VM process. Notice that we are
tracking the Erlang PID and not the RabbitMQ PID.
1. Check that `rabbitmqctl` does not return an Erlang VM PID

Once this completes on the bootstrap instance, BOSH will continue the same
sequence on the next instance. All remaining rabbitmq-server instances will be
stopped one by one.

<a id="serverfailprocess"></a><h3>What happens when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?</h3>

If the BOSH `stop` fails, you will likely get an error saying that the drain
script failed with:

<pre class="terminal">result: 1 of 1 drain scripts failed. Failed Jobs: rabbitmq-server.
</pre>

<a id="serverfailactions"></a><h3>What do I do when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?</h3>

The drain script logs to `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbitmq-server/drain.log`. If you
have a remote syslog configured, this will appear as the `rmq_server_drain`
program.

First, BOSH `ssh` into the failing rabbitmq-server instance and start the
rabbitmq-server job by running `monit start rabbitmq-server`. You will not be
able to start the job via BOSH `start` as this always runs the drain script first
and will fail since the drain script is failing.

Once rabbitmq-server job is running (confirm this via `monit status`), run `DEBUG=1`
`/var/vcap/jobs/rabbitmq-server/bin/drain`. This will tell you exactly why it’s
failing.

<a id="backup"></a><h3>How can I manually back up the state of the RabbitMQ cluster?</h3>

It is possible to back up the state of a RabbitMQ cluster for both the on-demand and pre-provisioned services  using the 
RabbitMQ Management API. Backups include vhosts, exchanges, queues and users. 

<h4>Back up Manually</h4>

1. Log in to the RabbitMQ Management UI as the admin user you created.  

1. Select **export definitions** from the main page.  

<h4>Back up and Restore with a Script</h4>

Use the API to run scripts with code similar to the following:  

1. For the backup:

    ```
    curl -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" "http://$RABBIT_ADDRESS:15672/api/definitions"
    -o "$BACKUP_FOLDER/rabbit-backup.json"
    ```

2. For the restore:

    ```
    curl -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" "http://$RABBIT_ADDRESS:15672/api/definitions"
    -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d
    "@$BACKUP_FOLDER/rabbit-backup.json"
    ```

<a id="preupgrade"></a><h3>What pre-upgrade checks should I do?</h3>

Before doing any upgrade of RabbitMQ, Pivotal recommends checking the following:

1. In Operations Manager check that the status of all of the instances is healthy.
2. Log into the RabbitMQ Management UI and check that no alarms have been triggered and that all nodes are healthy, that is, 
they should display as green.
3. Check that the system is not close to hitting either the memory or disk alarm. Do this by looking at what has been 
consumed by each node in the RabbitMQ Management UI.
