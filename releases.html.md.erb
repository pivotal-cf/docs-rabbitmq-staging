## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

For <%= vars.product_short %> v1.15 and v1.16, you can skip a
minor version when you upgrade.

See the following table to find your upgrade path:

| If you are on...  | Upgrade to...  |
|---|---|
| v1.16  | v1.18.4 or later patches |
| v1.15  | v1.17.3 or later patches |


If you are upgrading a version other than v1.16 or v1.15, do not
skip minor versions.

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/upgrade-planner' %>
## <a id="1-18-7"></a> v1.18.7

**Release Date**: April 24, 2020

### Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

* Wait for quorum critical nodes and mirror sync critical nodes to sync before upgrades.
* On demand instance plan features will display as bullets in Apps Manager
* Previously, we used `features.converge_variables` which may have side effects, e.g. BOSH Runtime configs variables maybe re-generated, 
  possibly causing downtime and other unexpected behaviour. We now use BOSH `update_mode: converge` instead of `feature.converge_variables` 
  to avoid these side effects.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/rabbitmq/quorum-upgrade-ki" %>
<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + "/rabbitmq/erlang-ki" %>

## <a id="1-18-2"></a> v1.18.2

**Release Date**: December 17, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Operators can configure an on-demand plan that enables service instances to connect to components outside
the <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation through AMQP.
For more information, see [Enabling Service-Gateway Access (Beta)](./service-gateway-access.html).
This functionality is planned for other supported protocols in later releases.
* This release uses RabbitMQ v3.8.2.
  For more information, see [RabbitMQ 3.8.2](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.8.2) in GitHub.
* This version supports quorum queues. For more information about quorum queues, see the
[RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html).
* Previously, operators could not set an upper limit on the number of on-demand service instances higher than 200.
This restriction has been removed.

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Usernames and passwords are removed from the RabbitMQ dashboard URL in a service
  binding because of a potential XSS vector.
  For more information, see this <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/pull/748">Remove
  direct login route pull request</a> in GitHub.<br>
  This means users are no longer automatically logged in when navigating to the dashboard URL.
  Instead, the user must explicitly enter their username and password on the RabbitMQ dashboard login page.
